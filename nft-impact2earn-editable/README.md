We have developed a basic version of the Impact2Earn NFT collection, which allows us to receive rewards for every transaction. In this collection, we can modify the content and reward parameters based on the type of recyclable material in the photograph, the amount of carbon credits, and valuable materials that can be extracted from waste.

We are working on writing a fully functional version.
